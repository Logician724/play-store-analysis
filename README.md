# CSEN1095 Data Engineering Course Project

This project is divided into the following components:

1. A Jupyter Notebook:
<br> Our notebook includes all the code, visualizations, and analysis results. It can be found [here](https://github.com/Logician724/play-store-analysis/blob/master/notebook.ipynb).

2. The Website:
<br> We have created a Github Page in which we present a summary of the main steps and results of this project. You can visit the page by following [this link](https://logician724.github.io/play-store-analysis/).

3. The Presentation:
<br> We decided to use the website as the presentation since it is well-organized and informative.
