## Overview and Motivation

Mobile applications are used around the world on a daily basis. They are now an integral part of many people's daily lives and provide users with many utilities. Today people download apps for countless purposes, such as education, communication, entertainment, and navigation. Google Play Store is one market for mobile applications. It houses millions of apps, which users can readily download and install on their devices. Not all apps, however, are successful. Many fail at launch or receive poor reviews, which result in poor ratings that send these apps into obscurity. New businesses attempting to penetrate the app market may need information to help them in the decision-making and app-development process. Only extensive statistical analysis can provide such information.

### The project

In this project, our goal is to explore some interesting relationships among a subset of the mobile apps on the Google Play Store. Furthermore, we will provide a data cleaning and transformation pipeline that can prepare the data for machine learning algorithms. And finally, we will attempt to predict the apps rating from the other features and properties of the apps.

### Our Tools

In our analysis, we have used several python libraries, including Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pyod and Scikit-Learn. Pandas was used for data storage and manipulation. Matplotlib and Seaborn were used for visualizations. Pyod was used for outlier detection, and Scikit-Learn was used for transformations, pipelining, and machine learning.
