 - [The Android App Market on Google Play](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/619) project page on DataCamp had some tasks listed, which gave us several indicators as to how we may approach the dataset.
 - Several [kernels on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/kernels) were aiming at exploring the same dataset as ours. We turned to some of them to look for cues that can help us optimise some of the pre-processing we attempted.
 - This [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095058491730215X) attempted to analyse the BlackBerry app store, investigating factors like price, rating, and offered features. Reading the paper gave us some insight into general app market analysis.
