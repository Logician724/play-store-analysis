At first, the data wasn't ready for analysis. So, we had to process it in a way that is friendly to answer our previously mentioned [questions](/play-store-analysis/questions.html). Along with that we had to change the shape of date in ways that enable us to gather more insights.

### Examples of data quality assurance steps
1. Handle missing type and version data.
2. Erase duplicate data.
3. Streamline the scales and unit of measurements of every feature.
4. Engineer new feature to derive more insights and answer questions.
5. Remove outliers that have values that deviate from the norm of the rest of the data.
